## Who we are

The Computer Science Club at <a href>Mahindra Ecole Centrale</a> is a student-run organization affiliated with the Computer Science and Engineering Department which provides learning, networking, and career opportunities to the members of Enigma.

We are an organization dedicated to providing MEC students with a tight-knit community of friends and mentors to promote and advocate computer science and working with tech. Community events include study breaks, social outings, and meet and greets between different classes. We also provide many professional resources for members including company-sponsored informational and networking events, resume review and algorithm challenge sessions, study breaks, social outings, and tech workshops. Two of our most popular initiatives are WeeklySessions and HackWeek. No membership fee or annual dues.

Our club faculty advisor is <a href>Prof. Prafulla Kalapatapu<a>.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to create a community of mentors and friends and partner with companies to provide the best resources for students to explore computer science and software. We hope you'll join us during the school year and join our community! If you want to learn more, feel free to message this year's president - <a href>Rahul Kumaran</a>; vice-president - <a href>Rochan Avlur</a> or secretary - <a href>Raghav NS</a>.
